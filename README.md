# TetraForce

![Build Godot Project](https://github.com/fornclake/TetraForce/workflows/Build%20Godot%20Project/badge.svg?branch=master)

TetraForce is an action adventure game inspired by the top-down Legend of Zelda games. It is designed to be very replayable for casual players and Zelda enthusiasts. The three features it will have to reach that goal is multiplayer, item randomizer, and moddability. Without these elements we will have a solid Zelda-inspired adventure. With all three added, it is a brand new Zelda experience.

It is built with the open source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
